            <p> Welcome to BR Event Planner, where we’re all about taking your events from ordinary to extraordinary!
                I’m
                Abhisek, the founder and owner of this amazing wedding and event planning company, and I specialize
                in creating personalized and unforgettable experiences for Traditional, Ethnic, Indian and
                Multi-Cultural weddings. Based out of Guntur, I also operate in the Vijayawada and Hyderabad, so you can count
                on me to handle your event regardless of location.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                With over a decade of experience under my belt, I’ve built strong relationships with suppliers all over
                the world, allowing me to negotiate the best deals in every aspect of your event. I pride myself on
                keeping you organized and ensuring that every detail is covered, so you can relax and enjoy your special
                day without worry.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My journey as an event planner started as an Audio-Visual coordinator for a Singaporean company in
                Thailand when I was 18. Soon afterwards, I joined the team at “I DO ETC”, where I was quickly promoted
                to lead wedding planner. Together with my team, I was able to plan and execute successful events all
                over the world, from Bali to Turkey and everywhere in between. It was an incredible experience, and I
                wouldn’t trade it for the world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In 2018, after getting married and moving to the Pacific Northwest, I decided to share my wealth of
                knowledge and experience with others by starting Eventcracker. I strive to provide high-quality service
                to each and every client, getting to know them personally and working with them to create a vision that
                represents their unique style and taste. After all, it’s all in the details!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                From pre-party planning to wedding rehearsals, engagement parties, traditional/modern ceremonies,
                receptions, and even destination weddings, I offer services tailored to fit your specific needs. Whether
                you’re looking for full planning, partial planning or day-of coordination, my team and I have the
                expertise to make your event a success. And if you need help managing your guest invitations, RSVPs,
                timelines, budget planning or vendor referrals, I’ve got you covered.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I’m also proud to say that I am a preferred wedding planner for some of the most exquisite wedding
                venues, including Cape Horn Estates, Scholls Valley Lodge and Casa Bella.
                Thank you for considering Eventcracker for your upcoming event! I’m excited to work with you and can’t
                wait to help make your special day unforgettable.
